**Title:** Method and System for Data Imputation Using Lagrangian Optimization with Laplacian Regularization

## Abstract
A method that optimizes only missing dataset entries via a Lagrangian-style objective combining proximity to an initial guess and Laplacian-based smoothness.

## Independent Claim (example)
1. A computer-implemented method for imputing missing entries comprising: receiving a dataset with missing entries; constructing an initial estimate for missing entries; defining an objective function that includes a proximity term and a Laplacian smoothness term; optimizing the objective with respect to the missing entries; and returning an imputed dataset.
